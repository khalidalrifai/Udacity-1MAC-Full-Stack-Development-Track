# Test Your Knowledge!

## Task 1:
* You are required to complete the function reverse(x). given a string "x" as an input it is expected to return that same string but reversed.
* Example:
  * input : "again"
  * output: "niaga"
  
  you can change the string value in the variable _text_ but you are not allowed to change the
variable names or edit any other code, except the function’s body, doing so may jeopardize your
evaluation.
  
  
## Task 2:
* You are required to complete the function average(x). where "x" is a list of numbers, and
contains more than 3 numbers. the function is expected to return the average from that
list.
* Example:
  * input : [10,20,30,40]
  * output: 25
  
  you can change the numbers in the list _no_list_ but you are not allowed to change the vari-able 
names or edit any other code, except the function’s body, doing so may jeopardize your
evaluation.


## Task 3:
* You are required to complete the function maximum(x). where "x" is a list of numbers,
and contains more than 2 numbers. the function is expected to return the highest number
in that list.
* Example:
  * input : [5,20,12,6]
  * output: 20
  
  you can change the numbers in the list no_list but you are not allowed to change the vari-
able names or edit any other code, except the function’s body, doing so may jeopardize your
evaluation.


## Task 4:
* You are required to complete the function unique_list(l). where "l" is a list of numbers.
the function is expected to return the unique numbers in that list.
* Example:
  * input : [1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,5,5,6]
  * output: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
  
 you are not allowed to change the variable names or their values or edit any other code,
except the function’s body, doing so may jeopardize your evaluation.
